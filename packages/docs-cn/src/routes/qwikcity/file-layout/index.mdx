# File Layout

The core responsibility of Qwik City is to provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to create content for your site. Qwik City achieves this through file-based routing. In a nutshell layout of your files determines the structure of your site.

## The `routes` directory

All file-based route information is placed in `src/routes` directory. This is the only directory where file naming conventions have implications for your site. (In all other folders, the names have no meaning to Qwik City.)

(the `src` folder also typically contains `components`, but the name and location have no meaning to Qwik City.)

## 简单的 `routes` 目录示例

```
src/
├── components/                # Put your reusable components here.
│    └── counter.tsx
└── routes/                    # Put your route specific components here.
    ├── docs/
    │   ├── overview/
    │   │   └── index.mdx      # https://example.com/docs/overview
    │   └── index.mdx          # https://example.com/docs
    ├── index.tsx              # https://example.com/
    └── layout.tsx             # All nested pages use this layout
```

## 示例 Component

位于`src/routes`目录下的`index.tsx`要用默认导出。

```typescript
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return <>Hello World!</>;
});
```
