# Static Assets

The `/public` folder is utilized to store all static assets such as images, fonts, etc.

All static assets are served from your server's root folder (`/` as in `https://example.com/`), and are superimposed under your routes. Note that routes take precedence.

```
public/
├── favicon.ico           # https://example.com/favicon.ico
└── images/
    └── logo.png          # https://example.com/images/logo.png
```

### Accessing Static Assets within the Application

To access and use static assets within your application, you can use the `useLocation` and `useResource$` functions. Below is an example that fetches a JSON file from the public folder:

```jsx
export default component$(() => {
  const loc = useLocation();
  const list = useResource$(() => {
    const url = `${loc.url.origin}/myJson.json`;
    return fetch(url).then((v) => v.json());
  });

  return (
    <Resource value={list} onResolved={(items) => (
      <ul>
        {items.map((item: { id: string }) => (
          <li key={item._id}>{item._id}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    )}/>
  );
});
```
In this example, `useLocation` is utilized to obtain the URL of the site, which helps construct the appropriate URL for fetching the JSON file.

This example is provided to assist newcomers to the Qwik framework. Understanding how to use the Qwik API might not be straightforward initially, and this example aims to offer a clearer path towards leveraging the API effectively.
