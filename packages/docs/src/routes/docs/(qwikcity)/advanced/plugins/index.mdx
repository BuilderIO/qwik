# Qwik Plugins
Qwik plugins, named as `plugin.ts` or `plugin@<name>.ts`, handle incoming requests prior to root layout execution and are located in the `src/routes` directory. Request handlers like `onRequest`, `onGet`, `onPost` in these plugins are called before `server$` functions. For multiple plugins, `plugin.ts` handlers execute first, followed by `plugin@<name>.ts` handlers in alphabetical order. Middleware functions should be defined in `plugin.ts` to ensure execution for all requests.


# `plugin@<name>.ts`

`plugin.ts` and `plugin@<name>.ts` files can be created in the root of the `src/routes` directory to handle any incoming request before even the root layout executes.

You can have multiple `plugin.ts` files, each with a different name. For example, `plugin@auth.ts` and `plugin@security.ts`. The `@<name>` is optional and it's only used for developers to help identify the plugin.

Requests handlers like `onRequest`, `onGet`, `onPost`, etc. are called before `server$` functions are executed.

### The order of execution of `plugin.ts` files

 If `plugin.ts` file exists and if it has exported request handlers, then they are executed first.

Then exported request handlers from `plugin@<name>.ts` files are executed in alphabetical order of the file names. For example, `onGet` from `plugin@auth.ts` is executed before `onGet` from `plugin@security.ts` because `auth` is alphabetically before `security`.

Finally, if a `server$` function exists, it's executed last.

## Middleware and `server$`

When using `server$`, it's important to understand how [middleware functions](/docs/middleware/#middleware-function) are executed. Middleware functions defined in `layout` files do not run for `server$` requests. This can lead to confusion, especially when developers expect certain middleware to be executed for both page requests and `server$` requests.

To ensure that a middleware function runs for both types of requests, it should be defined in the `plugin.ts` file. This ensures that the middleware is executed consistently for all incoming requests, regardless of whether they are normal page requests or `server$` requests.
