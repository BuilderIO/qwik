# Re-exporting loaders

`routeAction$` and `routeLoader$` are typically declared in route boundary files such as layout.tsx, index.tsx and plugin.tsx inside the routesDir directory
[here is docs](https://qwik.builder.io/docs/route-loader/).

Somethimes you would like to declared them outside of the route boundaries.
This may be useful when you want to create reusable logic or a library.
In such a case it is important that this function is re-exported from within the router boundary otherwise it will not run or throw exceptions.

## Solution

You can define `routeAction$` and `routeLoader$` in your custom path and re-export them in your layout.tsx, index.tsx and plugin.tsx files.

Example with this path `./src/shared/loaders.ts`

```tsx
import { routeAction$, routeLoader$ } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

// eslint-disable-next-line qwik/loader-location
export const useCommonRouteAction = routeAction$(async () => {
  // ...
});

// eslint-disable-next-line qwik/loader-location
export const useCommonRouteLoader = routeLoader$(async () => {
  // ...
});
```
---
Now you can use your common `routeAction$` and `routeLoader$` in paths like this one `./src/routes/index.tsx`.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';
import { Form } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';
import { useCommonRouteAction, useCommonRouteLoader } from '../shared/loaders';

// As mentioned, here we are re-exporting them
export { useCommonRouteAction, useCommonRouteLoader } from '../shared/loaders';

export default component$(() => {
  const commonRouteAction = useCommonRouteAction();
  const commonRouteLoader = useCommonRouteLoader();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Form action={commonRouteAction}>
        <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
      </Form>
      {commonRouteLoader.value}
    </div>
  );
});
```
