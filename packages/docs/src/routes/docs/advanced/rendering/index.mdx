# Rendering

Rendering is the process of updating the DOM based on

1. Changes in the state of the application
2. Changes in a *component's JSX* (Component Template)

Qwik is unique because it knows how to render component templates out-of-order and asynchronously.

- **Out-of-order**: When rendering components, Qwik does not enforce a strict parent-child rendering order. They can be rendered independently of each other, in any order.
- **Asynchronously**: Qwiks understands that it may need to download child components when rendering a page, and therefore the rendering operation must be asynchronous.

## Rendering child components

Qwik lazy loads components on an as-needed basis. To minimize the number of components to download, Qwik only downloads (or rerenders) a child component if the component's props have changed.

```tsx
export const Parent = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({ count: 0, step: 1 });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick$={() => (store.step *= -1)}>direction</button>
      <button onClick$={() => (store.count += store.step)}>{store.step}</button>
      <Greeter name={'World_' + store.count} />
    </>
  );
});

export const Greeter = component$((props: { name: string }) => {
  return <span>Hello {props.name}</span>;
});
```

In the above example, there are two buttons:

1. Clicking the first button changes the direction of the counter (`store.step` flips between `+1` and `-1`). Changing the `store` (the component's *state*) requires that the component be rerendered, with the second button then showing either `+1` or `-1`. However, since `<Greeter name={'World_' + store.count}/>` does not depend on the `store.step` state, Qwik will not download (or rerender) the `<Greeter>` component.
2. Clicking the second button increments/decrements `store.count`. This in turn causes the props on `<Greeter name={'World_' + store.count}/>` to change. A change in props means that Qwik will download and render (or rerender) `<Greeter>`. However, it is possible that Qwik does not have a reference to the `<Greeter>` component. In that case, Qwik will lazy-load the component and continue the rendering once the component is available to be rendered.
