### Rendering with `.map()`

In many cases you'll want to render components by mapping an array of data in the render function with `data.map()`. In these cases, it is required to provide a key to the root child of the mapping function.

```tsx
export const Parent = component$(() => {
  return (
    <>
      {data.map(({ content, uniqueKey }) => (
        <div key={uniqueKey}>
          <p>{content}</p>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
});
```

> **NOTE** It is not recommended to use the array's index as the key unless you can guarantee that the data for a given key will always be the same. It is always preferred to use some unique identifier derived from the data as the key.

### `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`

Qwik offers an attribute on HTML Elements called `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` as a replacement for calling `innerHTML` on the DOM. Due to cross-site-scripting (XSS) possibilities when rendering untrustworthy content, you must use this attribute to remind yourself that this operation might be dangerous.

```tsx
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={content}></div>
```
