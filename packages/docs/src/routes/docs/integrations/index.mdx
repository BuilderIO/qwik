# Integrations

Qwik CLI comes with integrations to make it easy to connect to your tooling and services.

Once you create a Qwik City application, run the following command to add new integrations:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm create qwik@latest
npm run qwik add
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
npm run qwik add
yarn create qwik@latest
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm create qwik@latest
npm run qwik add
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun create qwik@latest
npm run qwik add
```
  </span>
</PackageManagerTabs>
```shell
```

It will prompt you to select the integration you want to add. Once you select an integration, it will be added to your application and you can start using it.
