# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](../concepts/resumable/index.mdx) (no JS and no hydration), built for the edge and [familiar for React developers](../cheat/qwik-react/index.mdx).

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://qwik.new)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter/)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js v16.8](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
- Your favorite IDE ([vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](../think-qwik/index.mdx)

## Create an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a blank starter so that you can quickly familiarize yourself with it. Qwik supports NPM, yarn and pnpm.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

Choose the package manager you prefer and run one of the following commands:

```shell
npm create qwik@latest
pnpm create qwik@latest
yarn create qwik
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project-name, select one of the starters and asks if you want to install the dependencies.

### Start the development server

```shell
npm start
pnpm start
yarn start
```

## Qwik Hello World

To get you familiar with Qwik we have created a very simple "Hello World" application tutorial that touches on the most important concepts of Qwik, so that you can get a good overview. For each part we touch on we will link you to the relevant documentation where you can find out more.

### The Dad Jokes Application

We will use https://icanhazdadjoke.com as our API to get a random joke. We will create a simple application that will display a random joke and a button to get a new joke.


## Create A Route

Everything starts by serving a page at a particular route. So let's build a simple app that serves a random dad joke application on `/joke/` route. Qwikcity (Qwik's meta-framework) uses [directory-based](/docs/routing/) routing. To get started let's create a new `index.tsx` file in the `src/routes/joke/` directory in your project. (You will need to create the `joke` directory first.)

### Default Export Component

Each route's `index.tsx` file must have an `export default component$(...)` so that Qwikcity knows what content to serve. Paste the following content to `src/routes/joke/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";

export default component$(() => {
  return <div class="section bright">A Joke!</div>;
});
```

For more details about how to author components see the [Component API](/docs/(qwik)/components/overview/) section.


### Test Your Creation

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/joke/` to see your page.

NOTE: Your `joke` component is surrounded by an existing layout. See [Layout](/docs/layout/) for more details on what layouts are and how to work with them.

## Loading Data

A common thing a page does is load data to display to the user. This is performed using [route loaders](/docs/route-loader/).

### Code

Open `src/routes/joke/index.tsx` and add this code:

```tsx
import { routeLoader$ } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

const useDadJoke = routeLoader$(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", {
    headers: { Accept: "application/json" },
  });
  return (await response.json()) as {
    id: string;
    status: number;
    joke: string;
  };
});
```

Then add the `useDadJoke()` hook to the `default` component and use the result in the JSX:

```tsx
export default component$(() => {
  const dadJokeSignal = useDadJoke();
  return (
    <div class="section bright">
      <div>{dadJokeSignal.value.joke}</div>
    </div>
  );
});
```

What does the above code do?
- `routeLoader$` is used to retrieve data.
  - The function passed to `routeLoader$` is invoked on the server eagerly before any component is rendered and is responsible for loading data.
  - The `routeLoader$` returns a use-hook (`useDadJoke`) that can be used in the component to retrieve the server data.
- `useDadJoke` is a use-hook that returns a [signal](/docs/(qwik)/components/state/#usesignal/) of the server data.

Things to note:
- The `routeLoader$` is invoked eagerly on the server before any component is rendered, even if it's use-hook is not invoked in any component.
- The `routeLoader$` return type is inferred in the component without the need for any additional type information.

### Whole File (Just in Case)

`src/routes/joke/index.tsx`:
```tsx
import { component$ } from "@builder.io/qwik";
import { routeLoader$ } from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

const useDadJoke = routeLoader$(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://icanhazdadjoke.com/", {
    headers: { Accept: "application/json" },
  });
  return (await response.json()) as {
    id: string;
    status: number;
    joke: string;
  };
});

export default component$(() => {
  const dadJokeSignal = useDadJoke();
  return (
    <div class="section bright">
      <div>{dadJokeSignal.value.joke}</div>
    </div>
  );
});
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` to see the application running.

## Posting Data to Server

Previously we used `routeLoader$` to send data from the server to the client. We use `routeAction$` to post (send) data from the client back to the server.

NOTE: `routeAction$` is the preferred way to send data to the server because it uses the browser native form API which works even if JavaScript is disabled.

### Declaring a `routeAction$`

Open `src/routes/joke/index.tsx` and add this code:

```tsx
import {routeAction$, Form} from "@builder.io/qwik-city";

const useJokeVoteAction = routeAction$((props) => {
  // Leave it as an exercise for the reader to implement this.
  console.log("VOTE", props);
});
```

Update the  `export default` component.

```tsx
export default component$(() => {
  const dadJokeSignal = useDadJoke();
  const favoriteJokeAction = useJokeVoteAction();
  return (
    <div class="section bright">
      <div>{dadJokeSignal.value.joke}</div>
      <Form action={favoriteJokeAction}>
        <input type="hidden" name="jokeID" value={dadJokeSignal.value.id} />
        <button name="vote" value="up">
          üëç
        </button>
        <button name="vote" value="down">
          üëé
        </button>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
});
```

What does the above code do?
- `routeAction$` is used to receive data.
  - The function passed to `routeLoader$` is invoked on the server whenever the form is posted.
  - The `routeLoader$` returns a use-hook (`useJokeVoteAction`) that can be used in the component post the form data.
- `Form` is a convenience component that wraps the browser's native `<form>` element.

Things to note:
  - For validation see [zod validation](/docs/action/#zod-validation).
  - The `routeAction$` works even if JavaScript is disabled.
  - If JavaScript is enabled the `Form` component will prevent the browser from posting the form and instead post the data using JavaScript and emulate the browser's native form behavior without full refresh.
