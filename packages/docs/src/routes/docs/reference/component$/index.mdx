# `component$`

Components are the basic building blocks of Qwik Applications. 
They are created using [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) 
and are very similar to other frameworks' components.

## API

### `component$<Props>(componentFn): Component<Props>`


### Properties

componentFn


## Usage

## `component$()`

Here's an example of a simple component: 

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const MyCmp = component$(() => {
  return <p>Hello, world!</p>
});

```

A component is a small, reusable piece of code that can be used to build your user interface (UI).


> ### But what's the deal with this $ sign?
>
> Qwik's super powers come from its ability to automatically split the application to tiny chunks that will later be streamed to the user. 
> The $ sign in the end of most of Qwik's API helps its optimizer (compiler) to know where to split the code.
> To learn more [please visit the optimizer doc](../../advanced/optimizer/#optimizer)



## Props

Props (or properties) are used to pass data into a component. Props are declared as named arguments of the component.

In this example a component `Item` declares optional `name`, `quantity`, `description`, and `price`.

```tsx
interface ItemProps {
   description?: string;
   price?: number;
}

export const Item = component$((props: ItemProps) => {
  return <div>
    <h2>{props.description}</h2>
    <p>{props.price}</p>
  </div>;
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ as you see above, in JSX, you can render variables using the `{ varName }` syntax
> trace in the browser HTML tree.



## Nesting components

Qwik components can be nested in other components and you can pass props to them.

```tsx
export const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      This is a counter:
      
      <Counter step={1} />
    </div>
  );
});

interface CounterProps {
   step?: number;
}

export const Counter = component$((props: CounterProps) => {
  return <span>
    {props.step}
  </span>
});

```


## Fragments

In JSX, you can only have one root element.
In order to prevent adding unnecessary div elements, we can use an "empty" element called a "fragment" with the empty tags `<>` and `</>` which replaces the need for a root element. 

These won't be visible in the rendered html of the component.


```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const MyCmp = component$(() => {
  return <>Look ma! I'm a real html!</>
});

```
