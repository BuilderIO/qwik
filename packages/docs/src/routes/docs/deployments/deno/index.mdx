# Deno Middleware

Qwik City Deno middleware allows you to hook up Qwik City to a Deno server which uses the standard Request/Response that's well supported by Deno. Some Deno server implementations include:

- [Deno's integrated HTTP server](https://deno.com/manual/examples/http_server)
- [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/)

## Installation

To integrate the `deno` adapter, use the `add` command:

- For the [integrated HTTP server](https://deno.com/manual/examples/http_server):

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run qwik add deno
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run qwik add deno
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run qwik add deno
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run qwik add deno
```
  </span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run build
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run build
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run build
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run build
```
  </span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Serve

To start the Deno server after a build:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <span q:slot="npm">
```shell
npm run serve
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="yarn">
```shell
yarn run serve
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm run serve
```
  </span>
  <span q:slot="bun">
```shell
bun run serve
```
  </span>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Production deploy

Since you are choosing Deno, here you are in your own, after running `npm run build`:

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.
