# Bun Middleware

Qwik City Bun middleware allows you to hook up Qwik City to a Bun server which uses the Bun Http API.

## Installation

There currently is an issue with using `bun` as the package manager. Please use `npm install`.

To integrate the `bun` adapter, use the `add` command:

- For the [integrated HTTP server](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http):

```shell
npm run qwik add bun
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `bun run build.server` and `bun run build.client`:

```shell
bun run build
```

## Serve

To start the Bun server after a build:

```shell
bun run serve
```

## Production deploy

Since you are choosing Bun, here you are in your own, after running `bun run build`:

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.
