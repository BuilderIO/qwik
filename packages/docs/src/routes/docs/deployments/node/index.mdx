# Node Middleware

Qwik City Node middleware allows you to connect Qwik City to a Node.js server which uses the common middleware functionality. Some Node servers include:

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)
- [Connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect)
- [Polka](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polka)

## Installation

To integrate the `node` adapter, use the `add` command:

- For [Express](https://expressjs.com/):

```shell
npm run qwik add express
```

- For [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)

```shell
npm run qwik add fastify
```

## Production build

To build the application for production, use the `build` command, this command will automatically run `npm run build.server` and `npm run build.client`:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Dev serve

To deploy the application for development:

```shell
npm run serve
```

## Production deploy

Since you are choosing Node, here you are in your own, after running `npm run build`:

- The `dist` folder will be created including all the static files.
- The `server` folder will be created including all node server files.

In order to deploy the server, you need to run the `server/entry.[server].js` file in the server of your choice, where `[server]` can be [express](https://expressjs.com/) or [fastify](https://fastify.dev/).

It's **very important to correctly configure the `ORIGIN` env variable**, which is used to check against [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf). The origin must match the origin of the client application.

> For example, if you plan to deploy your application to `https://example.com/app`, then you need to set the `ORIGIN` environment variable to `https://example.com`.
>
> ```shell
> ORIGIN=https://example.com node server/entry.express
> ```

### Using Docker

If you want to deploy using Docker, here's a Dockerfile example using Node v18 and yarn. You can edit it accordingly to use npm, pnpm or bun:
 ```docker
 ARG NODE_VERSION=18.18.2

################################################################################
# Use node image for base image for all stages.
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine as base

# Set working directory for all build stages.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

################################################################################
# Create a stage for installing production dependecies.
FROM base as deps

# Download dependencies as a separate step to take advantage of Docker's caching.
# Leverage a cache mount to /root/.yarn to speed up subsequent builds.
# Leverage bind mounts to package.json and yarn.lock to avoid having to copy them
# into this layer.
RUN --mount=type=bind,source=package.json,target=package.json \
    --mount=type=bind,source=yarn.lock,target=yarn.lock \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.yarn \
    yarn install --frozen-lockfile

################################################################################
# Create a stage for building the application.
FROM deps as build

# Copy the rest of the source files into the image.
COPY . .

# Run the build script.
RUN yarn run build

################################################################################
# Create a new stage to run the application with minimal runtime dependencies
# where the necessary files are copied from the build stage.
FROM base as final

# Use production node environment by default.
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV ORIGIN https://example.com

# Run the application as a non-root user.
USER node

# Copy package.json so that package manager commands can be used.
COPY package.json .

# Copy the production dependencies from the deps stage and also
# the built application from the build stage into the image.
COPY --from=deps /usr/src/app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /usr/src/app/server ./server

# Expose the port that the application listens on.
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application.
CMD yarn serve
 ```

 You can now build your docker image:

 ```shell
 docker build -t your-image .
 ```

And start a Docker container:

 ```shell
docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 your-image
 ```

### CSRF Protection

By default, all Qwik City applications are protected against [CSRF attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) for all POST, PATCH, DELETE form submits.

This protection is enabled by default and it's the reason why you need to set the `ORIGIN` environment variable when deploying your application for production.

If you want to disable CSRF protection, you can set `checkOrigin: false` in the `createQwikCity()` options in `src/entry.express.tsx`:

```tsx {6} /checkOrigin/ title="entry.express.tsx"
// ...
const { router, notFound, staticFile } = createQwikCity({
  render,
  qwikCityPlan,
  manifest,
  checkOrigin: false,
});
// ...
```
