# Inlined JSX Functions

In addition to standard Qwik components that have all of its lazy-loaded properties, Qwik also supports inlined jsx functions that act more like components in traditional frameworks.

```tsx
// Inlined JSX Function: declared using a standard function.
export const MyButton = (props: { text: string }) => {
  return <button>{props.text}</button>;
};

// Component: declared using `component$()`.
export const MyApp = component$(() => {
  return (
    <div>
      Some text:
      <MyButton text="Click me" />
    </div>
  );
});
```

In the above example, the `MyButton` is a Inlined JSX Function. Inlined JSX Functions' are merged with the regular component they are part of. In this case:

- `MyButton` will get bundled with the `MyApp` render function.
- Whenever the render function of `MyApp` executes, it will also force the execution of `MyButton`.
- `MyButton` does not have a host element.

Inlined JSX functions are inlined into the component where they are instantiated.

> **Limitations**
> Unlike regular Qwik components, Inlined JSX Functions can not use `use` methods, such as `useSignal` or `useStore`. As it name implies, Inlined JSX Functions are better used sparsely for lightweight pieces of markup since they offer the convenience of being bundled with the parent component.
