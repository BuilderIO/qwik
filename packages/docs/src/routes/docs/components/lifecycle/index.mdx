# Lifecycles

Thanks to [Resumability](/docs/concepts/resumable/index.mdx), components life and its lifecycle extend across server and browser. Sometimes the component will be first rendered in the server, sometimes it could be in the browser, however, in both cases the lifecycle will be the same, only its execution happens in different environments.

Usually **the life of a component starts on the server** (during SSR or SSG), in that case, the hooks will run like this:

```
  useTask$ --> RENDER --> useClientDOM$
                       |
| ------ SERVER ------ | --- BROWSER --- |
                       |
                  pause|resume
```

> **Notice** that because the component was mounted in the server, **only useClientDOM$() runs in the browser**. This is because the browser continues the same lifecycle, that was paused in the server right after the render and resumed in the browser.

Sometimes a component will be first mounted/rendered in the browser, for example when the user SPA navigates to a new page, or a "modal" component first appears in the page. In that case, the lifecycle will run like this:

```
  useTask$ --> RENDER --> useClientDOM$

| -------------- BROWSER -------------- |
```

> **Notice** that the lifecycle is exactly the same, but this time all the hooks run in the browser, and non in the server.


## `useTask$()`

- **When:** BEFORE component's first render, and when tracked state changes
- **Times:** at least once
- **Platform:** server and browser

`useTask$()` registers a hook to be executed upon component creation, it will run at least once either in the server or in the browser, depending where the component is initially rendered.

Additionally, this task can be reactive and re-execute when some **tracked** [signal or store](/docs/components/state/index.mdx) changes, like this:

```tsx
useTask$(({track}) => {
  track(() => store.count));
  // will run when the component mounts and every time "store.count" changes
})
```

**Notice that any subsequent execution will always happen in the browser**, because reactivity is a client-only thing.

```
  useTask$(track signal) -> RENDER -> CLICK (signal changes) -> RE-RUN useTask$(track)
  ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔            |                          ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔
| --------- SERVER --------- | --------------- BROWSER --------------- |
                             |
                        pause|resume
```

> If `useTask$()` does not track any state, it will run **exactly once**, either in the server **or** in the browser (**not both**), depending where the component is initially rendered. Effectively behaving like an "on mount" hook.

`useTask$()` will block the rendering of the component until after its async callback resolves. (This is useful for fetching asynchronous data and delaying rendering until data is received, ensuring that the rendered component contains the data)


### Example

The `useTask$()` function is used to observe the `state.count` property. Any changes to the `state.count` cause the `watchFn` to execute which in turn updates the `state.doubleCount` to the double of `state.count`.

```tsx
import { component$, useStore, useTask$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    count: 1,
    doubleCount: 0,
  });

  // this task will be called exactly once, either on the server or on the browser
  useTask$(() => {
    console.log('component mounted');
  });

  // this task will be called at mount and every time `store.count` changes
  useTask$(({ track }) => {
    const count = track(() => store.count);
    store.doubleCount = 2 * count;
  });

  return (
    <div>
      {store.count} / {store.doubleCount}
    </div>
  );
});
```

The example above uses the `track` function to watch changes in `() => store.count`. The callback will run once in the SSR when the component is mounted and every time `store.count` changes.

> Notice that `useTask$()` runs **BEFORE** the actual rendering and in the server, thus manual DOM manipulation must be done with caution.

> See also the `useClientDOM$()` hook that shares similar semantics but only runs on the client after rendering.

### When to use `useTask$()`

- Run async tasks before rendering
- Run code only once before component is first rendered
- Compute derived state from tracked state
- Programatically run code when state changes

> Note, if you wanna load some data (for example a fetch()), to later use that in your component, look at [`useResource$()`](/docs/components/resource/index.mdx). This API will be even more efficiently leveraging SSR streaming and parallelisim.

### Server/Client only task

Sometimes is desired to only run code either in the server or in the client. This can be achieved by using the `isServer` and `isBrowser` conditionals exported in  `@builder.io/qwik/build`.

```tsx
import { isServer, isBrowser } from '@builder.io/qwik/build';

export const Cmp = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    users: [],
  });
  useTalk$(async () => {
    if (isServer) {
      // If the component is mounted on the server, call DB directly.
      store.users = await db.requestUsers();
    }
    if (isBrowser) {
      // If the component is mounted on the browser, fetch users through API.
      store.users = await fetchGetUser();
    }
  });

  return (
    <>
      {store.users.map((user) => (
        <User user={user} />
      ))}
    </>
  );
});
```

## `useClientDOM$()`

- **When:** AFTER component's first render and on tracked state changes
- **Times:** at least once
- **Platform:** browser only

For all components that got mounted during SSR (in the server), the `useClientDOM$()` will run eagarly, that means, without user interaction, but the eagerness can be configured!

```tsx
useClientDOM$(() => console.log('runs in the browser'), {
  eagerness: 'visible', // 'load' | 'visible' | 'idle'
});
```

This is a unique feature of Qwik, any other frameworks would execute this and other code as part of hydration, but in Qwik, we can even specify when it happens:

- `"visible"`: when the component becomes visible in the viewport (uses [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) under the hood). This is the default value.
- `"load"`: when the documents finish loading (the document's "load" event)
- `"idle"`: after load the first moment the site becomes idle. It uses [`requestIdleCallback()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback) under the hood.

Like `useWatch`

### Example

```tsx
export const Timer = component$(() => {
  const store = useStore({
    count: 0,
  });
  useClientDOM$(() => {
    // Only runs in the client
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      store.count++;
    }, 500);
    return () => {
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  });
  return <>{store.count}</>;
});
```

> **NOTE:** Don't abuse `useClientDOM$()` when the same logic can be achieved using `useTask$()` or other means. Ask to yourself: Does this code really need to run at the beginning in the browser? If the answer is no, `useClientDOM$()` is probably not the right answer.

> How does it compare with React's `useEffect()`? Both APIs share a lot of semantics, but while both run AFTER rendering,`useClientDOM$()` can run also independently from rendering.

### When to use `useClientDOM$()`

You need to run JS right at loading time of the page, even if the user never interacts with the page.

- Read the DOM after rendering
- Initialize some animations
- WebGL logic
- Use DOM APIs like `localStorage`
- Runs some code without user interaction, like a setInterval()

## Use Method Rules

When using lifecycle hooks, you must adhere to the following rules:

- They can only be called in `component$`
- They can only be called at the root level of a function / arrow function context, not inside of branches or conditional blocks
- They can only be called from another `use*$` method, allowing for composition

```tsx
useHook(); // <-- ❌ does not work

export default component$(() => {
  useCustomHook(); // <-- ✅ does work
  if (condition) {
    useHook(); // <-- ❌ does not work
  }
  const myQrl = $(() => useHook()); // <-- ❌ does not work
  return <button onClick$={() => useHook()}></button>; // <-- ❌ does not work
});

const useCustomHook = () => {
  useHook(); // <-- ✅ does work
};
```
