# Auth.js

Authentication for the Web.

Everything you know and love from Auth.js implemented as a Qwik plugin.

## Installation

You can add Auth.js easily by using one of the following Qwik starter scripts for the package manager of your choice:

```shell
npm run qwik add auth
pnpm qwik add auth
yarn qwik add auth
nr qwik add auth
```

The previous command updates your app code, dependency and sets the correct configuration in `vite.config.ts`.

It also adds a new file inside to your `src/routes` folder.

- `plugin@auth.ts`

## Usage

You can configure it like you would any other Auth.js implementation.  Check the [Auth.js documentation](https://authjs.dev) for more details.

`pluging@auth.ts`
```ts
export const { onRequest, useAuthSession, useAuthSignin, useAuthSignout } = serverAuth$(
  ({ env }) => ({
    secret: env.get('AUTH_SECRET'),
    trustHost: true,
    providers: [
      GitHub({
        clientId: env.get('GITHUB_ID')!,
        clientSecret: env.get('GITHUB_SECRET')!,
      }),
    ] as Provider[],
  })
);
```
