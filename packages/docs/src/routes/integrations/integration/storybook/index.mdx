# Storybook

Storybook is a frontend tool for building UI components and pages in isolation.
It helps you develop hard-to-reach states and edge cases without needing to run
the whole app. You can test and preview components in a local Storybook UI or
deploy a preview of Storybook to a server to share with your team.

## Usage

You can add Storybook easily by using the following Qwik starter script:

```shell
npm run qwik add storybook
```

> The default configuration for Storybook requires Nodejs v17 or higher

The previous command will add a folder under `.storybook` that holds the
Storybook configuration. Essential dependencies and scripts are added to your
package.json, and a new component is added to `src/components/story-example`
with a Story to get you started.

You can now run a preview server with:

```shell
npm run storybook
```

You can add stories to your components by adding a `component.stories.tsx` which
Storybook will pick up on automatically.

```tsx
import { Meta } from '@storybook/html';
import { StoryExample, StoryExampleProps } from './story-example';

export default {
  title: 'Story Example',
  args: {
    label: 'Example label',
    color: 'red',
  },
  argTypes: {
    color: {
      options: ['red', 'green', 'blue'],
      control: {
        type: 'select',
      },
    },
  },
} as Meta;

type Options = StoryExampleProps & { label: string };

const Template = ({ label, color }: Options) =>
    <StoryExample color={color}>
      {label}
    </StoryExample>;

export const Default = Template.bind({});
```
