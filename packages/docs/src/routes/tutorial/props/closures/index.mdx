title: Passing Closures

Props are serializable so that Qwik can resume and render each component independently. There's a problem though. What if you want to include a callback to a child component? Callbacks are functions that are normally not serializable, but they are in Qwik.

Qwik serializes functions via the `$()` function by first converting them to [Qwik URLs (QRLs)](/docs/advanced/qrl).

## QRLs

QRLs are serialized forms of a function that Qwik uses to pass functions across serializable boundaries. To help make serialization easy, Qwik features a set of convenience APIs which end in `$`. These convenience functions are equivalent to calling `$()` directly.

The following two lines are essentially the same:

- **inline**: `<button onClick$={() => alert('click')}/>`
- **explicit**: `<button onClickQrl={$(() => alert('click'))}/>`

The *inline* technique is the most common approach as callbacks are implemented directly on an element. However, sometimes you need to use the *explicit* form to separate where a function is declared from where it is used.

## Declaring callback props

A component can declare a callback in its props via property naming or type declaration.

### Naming

Having a property that ends in `$` signals to Qwik the property expects a callback. For example:

```
component.goodbye$
```

### Type declaration

The type of the property is `PropFunction<T>` where `T` is the lazy reference type that the QRL points to (function signature).

```typescript
interface MyComponentProps {
  goodbye$: PropFunction<() => void>;
  hello$: PropFunction<() => void>;
}

export const MyComponent = component$((props: MyComponentProps) => { ... });
```

This allows the user of `<MyComponent>` to use `goodbye$` form as shown here:

```jsx
<MyComponent goodbye$={goodbyeQrl} hello$={() => {...}} />
```

## Using callback props

Notice that the `<MyComponent>` component receives a callback function.

Passing the `props.goodbye$` as a reference to the `<button>`

```jsx
<button onClick$={props.goodbye$}>hello</button>
```

Creating a new callback for `<button>` and internally invoking the callback QRL.

```jsx
<button
  onClick$={async () => {
    await props.helloQrl?.invoke('World');
  }}
>
  good bye
</button>
```

This form allows the `<button>` to invoke the callback with custom parameters. Notice that the invocation requires `async` and `await` as the QRLs are lazy-loaded.
