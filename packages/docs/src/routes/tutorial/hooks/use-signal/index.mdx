Use `useSignal()` to store any single value similar to `useStore()`. 

Some examples would be:
```
const intStore = useSignal(0);
const stringStore = useSignal('foo');
const booleanStore = useSignal(true);
const objectStore = useSignal({fruite: 'apple', color: 'green'});
const arrayStore = useSignal(['banana','oranges']);
```

To read or update the values you can simple access the `value` property
```
<>
  <button onClick$={() => intStore.value++}>Click me</button>
  <div>{intStore.value}</div>
</>
```

It is also able to hold a reference of a DOM element created by the component.

There are two parts to retrieving a DOM element reference:

1. `useSignal()` returns a store object that contains a `value` property which will eventually contain the reference.
2. `ref={_ref_variable_}` is a prop binding that will set the `value` property of the `ref` object to the DOM element.

### Example

The example on the right uses `useSignal()` to get a reference to the `input` element. However, it is missing the `ref` prop binding. Add the `ref` prop binding to make the example work as expected.
