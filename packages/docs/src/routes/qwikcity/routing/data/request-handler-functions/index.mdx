# Implementing Request Handler functions

On pages and layout component, we can access request data by implementing request handler functions such as ``onGet``, ``onPost``, ``onPut`` etc.

These functions are executed, each one, according to the HTTP method used for this route. 

This function is run before the component is rendered 
## Example - accessing cookies from request headers
```typescript
export const onGet: RequestHandler = async ({request}) => {
  // on getCookies you may write a code that parse the cookie header 
  // and have the cookies as an object of cookie name and value dictionary. 
  const cookiesObj = getCookies(request.headers.get("cookie"));
  const token = cookiesObj.token;
  // With the token you may proceed, for example, to an authentication required API
  doSomethingWithToken(token);
};
```

## Parameter fields

The ``onGet`` function gets a ``RequestEvent`` object which has the following fields:
1. request - Request Object
2. url - URL object
3. params - URL params object
4. response - Response object
5. platform - Platform data object
6. next - Next middleware function
7. abort - Request abortion function 


This feature actually enables you to handle the request event, have side effects on the request pipeline, just before you render the component.

It is available on Layouts and pages, but not on regular components.
