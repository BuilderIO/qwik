# File Layout

The core responsibility of Qwik City is to provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to create content for your site. Qwik City achieves this through directory-based routing. In a nutshell layout of your directories determines the structure of your site.

## The `routes` directory

All directory-based route information is placed in `src/routes` directory. This is the only directory where directory and file naming conventions have implications for your site. (In all other folders, the names have no meaning to Qwik City.)

(the `src` folder also typically contains `components`, but the name and location have no meaning to Qwik City.)

## Sample `routes` directory example

```
──src/
  ├─components/          # Put your reusable components here.
  │ └─counter.tsx
  └─routes/              # Put your route-specific components here.
    ├─docs/
    │ ├─overview/
    │ │ └─index.mdx      # https://example.com/docs/overview
    │ └─index.mdx        # https://example.com/docs
    ├─index.tsx          # https://example.com/
    └─layout.tsx         # All nested pages use this layout
```

## Sample Component

Qwik City expects that `index.tsx` files that are in the `src/routes` folder have a `default` export.

```tsx
import { component$ } from '@builder.io/qwik';

export default component$(() => {
  return <>Hello World!</>;
});
```

## Structure options

You can customize how the directory and file strcture works by using the `structure` option in `vite.config`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { qwikVite } from '@builder.io/qwik/optimizer';
import { qwikCity } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/vite';
import tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      qwikCity({
        structure: {
          // structure options here
        }
      }),
      qwikVite(),
      tsconfigPaths()
    ],
  };
});
```

```ts
interface StructureOptions {
  /**
   * Marker for the layout name to be applied to the component.
   * 
   * Default is `'@'`
   */
  layoutNameMarker?: string;
}
```
