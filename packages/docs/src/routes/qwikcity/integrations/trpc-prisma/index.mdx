# tRPC

tRPC is for full-stack TypeScript developers and it's an alternative to traditional REST or GraphQL.
it allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs, without schemas or code generation.
If your project is built with full-stack TypeScript, you can share types directly between your client and server, without relying on code generation.

# Prisma

Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM
Prisma unlocks a new level of developer experience when working with databases thanks to its intuitive data model, automated migrations, type-safety & auto-completion.

└── schema.prisma
└── seed.ts
src/
└── client/
|   └── trpc.ts
└── trpc-server/
|   └── context.ts
|   └── trpc.ts
|   └── router/
|       └── framework.ts
|       └── index.ts
└── routes/
    └── trpc-prisma/
    |   └── index.tsx
    └── api/
        └── trpc/
            └── [trpc]/
                └── index.ts
```
