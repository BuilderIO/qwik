## Responding to user events

An important part of an application is responding to the user input. To demonstrate that, we will add a `keyup` event listener to the `<input>` that will allow the user to change the `store.organization`.

1. Add `keyup` event listener to the `<input>` which updates the `store.organization`:
   ```html
   <input
     value={store.organization}
     onKeyup$={(e) => (store.organization = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)}
   />
   ```

Notice that tying into the `<input>` updates the `<a href>` link on the page. This is because Qwik understands that `store.organization` is used in the `<GitHubRepositories>` JSX component, and therefore any changes to the `store.organization` require that the `<GitHubRepositories>` is re-rendered.


In our next step, we will use the `store.organization` to retrieve a set of repositories from Github for a given organization.
