# Getting Started Qwikly

Qwik is a new kind of framework that is [resumable](./concepts/resumable.mdx) (No initial JS and no hydration), built for the edge, and familiar to React developers.

- [Stackblitz Qwik + Vite](https://stackblitz.com/edit/qwik-vite-todoapp?file=index.html)
- [Examples playground](/examples/reactivity/counter)


## Prerequisites

- `node.js` v16 or higher (with `npm`) (Qwik only requires `node.js` v14, but for this example we use v16.)
- Your favorite IDE (vscode recommended)
- Start to [think qwik](./think-qwik.mdx)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a Todo sample app, and we will use that application to do a walk-through of Qwik so that you can familiarize yourself with it.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

```shell
$ npm init qwik@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project name and select one of the starters:

<script id="asciicast-qUXqQ0NBndDvBQ59pNDaOM9Eu" src="https://asciinema.org/a/qUXqQ0NBndDvBQ59pNDaOM9Eu.js" async></script>

After your new app is created, you will see an output like the following in your terminal:

```shell
💫 Let's create a Qwik project 💫

✔ Project name … qwik-app
✔ Select a starter › Starter
✔ Select a server › Express

⭐️ Success! Project saved in qwik-todo directory

   cd qwik-app                                                                  
   npm install                                                                  
   npm start

At this point, you will have `qwik-app` directory, which contains the starter app.
