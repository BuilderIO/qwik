## Storing component state with useStore

The store is used for storing component state. (A store is different from props in that it is usually a component's internal state rather than data from the parent component, as is the case for props.) Stores are declared using the `useStore()` function. 

In our example, we will use the `props.organization` as the initial value of the `organization` and store it in `store.organization`. In the next step, we will add code that will allow us to edit the `store.organization`. 

1. Update the `import` to include `useStore` symbol.
   ```typescript
   import { component$, useStore } from "@builder.io/qwik";
   ```

2. Add `useStore()` in the `GitHubRepositories` function and default it to `"BuilderIO"`:
   ```typescript
   export const GitHubRepositories = component$(
     (props: GithubRepositoriesProps) => {
       const store = useStore({
         organization: props.organization || "BuilderIO",
       });
       // ...
     }
   );
   ```

3. Finally, use the `store.organization` instead of `props.organization` in the JSX bindings.
   ```html
   <span>
     GitHub username:
     <input value={store.organization} />
   </span>
   <div>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <a href={`https://github.com/${store.organization}/qwik`}>Qwik</a>
       </li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   ```

At this point, the `GitHubRepositories` component uses the `props.organization` as an initial value of `organization`. The value is copied and stored in `store.organization`, and it is bound in the JSX. In the next step, we will add event listeners to the `<input>` to allow the user to update the organization.
