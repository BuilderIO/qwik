title: Qwikcity Getting Started - Installation
---

# Getting started with Qwikcity

## Prerequisites

- `node.js` v14 or higher (with `npm`)
- Your favorite IDE (vscode recommended)

## Creating an app using the CLI

The first step is to create an application. Qwik comes with a CLI that allows you to create a basic working skeleton of an application. We will use the CLI to create a Todo sample app, and we will use that application to do a walk-through of Qwik so that you can familiarize yourself with it.

### Run the Qwik CLI in your shell

```shell
$ npm init qwik@latest
```

The CLI will guide you through an interactive menu to set the project name and select one of the starters:

```shell
💫 Let's create a Qwik project 💫

? Project name › qwik-site
? Select a starter › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Qwikcity - Starter with built-in routing, powered by Qwikcity
    Starter
    Starter Builder
    Starter Partytown
    Todo
? Select a server › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯   Express - Express.js server.
    Cloudflare Pages
    Netlify
    Setup later
? Features ›  
◉   Prettier - Prettier code formatter.
◉   Eslint
◉   Tailwindcss
```

After your new app is created, you will see an output like the following in your terminal:

```shell
💫 Let's create a Qwik project 💫

✔ Project name … qwik-site
✔ Select a starter › Starter
✔ Select a server › Express

⭐️ Success! Project saved in qwik-todo directory

   cd qwik-site                                                                  
   npm install                                                                  
   npm start

At this point, you will have `qwik-site` directory, which contains the Qwikcity starter app.
