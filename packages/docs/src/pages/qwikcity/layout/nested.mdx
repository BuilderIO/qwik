# Qwikcity - Nested Layout

At times it is desirable to nest layouts into each other.

The developer could extract all of these into `<Header>`, `<Footer>`, and `<Menu>` components, but that is error-prone and repetitive. Instead, we can use layouts to automatically reuse common parts.

## Example

Let's say we would like our site to look like this:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Header                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Menu    | <ROUTE_SPECIFIC_CONTENT>                |
| - main  |                                         |
| - about |                                         |
|         |                                         |
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Footer                                            |
+---------------------------------------------------+

```
