# Qwikcity Overview

Qwikcity is a companion meta-framework to Qwik. Use Qwikcity to create websites and webapps. (Currently, Qwikcity is focusing on multi-page-application (MPA) development, but single-page-application (SPA) development is next on our roadmap.)

Use Qwikcity to build an e-commerce website, blog site, or any other website that needs routing, layouts, templating, data retrieval/updates, and behavior. Qwikcity is built on Qwik, and therefore Qwikcity sites are resumable and only download the minimal amount of JavaScript with fine-grained lazy loading.

Qwikcity provides:
- File-based routing
- Nested layouts
- File-based menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Support authoring content with `.tsx` or `.mdx` file formats
- Data endpoints

Qwikcity sites are fast by default:
- Are resumable => Score highly on Google PageSpeed even when the pages become complex.
- Downland minimal JavaScript => Qwik ensures that only the necessary JavaScript is downloaded lazily, not upfront.
- Come with Partytown => Move your third-party code into web-workers.
