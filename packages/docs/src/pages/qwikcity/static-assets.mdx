# Qwikcity - Static Assets


Use `/public` folder to store all static assets such as images, fonts, etc.

All static assets are served from your server's root (`/`) folder and superimposed under your routes (routes have priority.)

```
- public/
  - favicon.ico         # http://localhost:3002/favicon.ico
  - images/
    - logo.png          # http://localhost:3002/images/logo.png
```
