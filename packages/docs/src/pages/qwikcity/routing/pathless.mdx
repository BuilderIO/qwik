# Qwikcity - Pathless

At times components get so complex that using `index.ts` is not enough, and they need their own directory structure. In that case, Qwikcity allows you to use to place the component into its own directory prefixed with `_`. Qwikcity will then not use that directory name in the user URL.

```
- src/
  - routes/
    - some/           
      - path/
        - _complex-component/      # Notice the `_` prefix
          - index.tsx              # http://server/some/path  (`_complex-component` is not used.)
          - _other_component.tsx   # this file is ignored and not mapped to any URL.
```
