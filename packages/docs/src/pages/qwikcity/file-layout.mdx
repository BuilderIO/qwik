# Qwikcity - File Layout

The core responsibility of Qwikcity is to provide a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to create content for your site. Qwikcity achieves this through file-based routing. In a nutshell layout of your files determines the structure of your site.

## The `routes` directory

All file-based route information is placed in `src/routes` directory. This is the only directory where naming conventions have implications for your site. (In all other folders, the names have no meaning to Qwikcity.)

(the `src` folder also typically contains `components`, but the name and location have no meaning to Qwikcity.)


## Sample `routes` directory example

```
- src/
  - components/          # Put your reusable components here.
    - counter.tsx
  - route/               # Put your route specific components here.
    - docs/
      - overview.mdx     # http://server/docs/overview
      - index.mdx        # http://server/docs/
    - index.tsx          # http://server/
```
