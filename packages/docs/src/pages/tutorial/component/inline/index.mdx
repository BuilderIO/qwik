Qwik components are lazy-loadable, which lies at the heart of what makes Qwik different from most other frameworks.

You can mark a component as lazy-loadable by using the `component$()` method. When you see a `$` in Qwik code, you're encountering a lazy-loading boundary.

If you want to ensure a component loads with another component, you create an inline component. Inline components load as a part of the parent component and are equivalent to how most other frameworks deal with components.

In this example, the `<App>` and a `<Greeter>` components are prepared for you. The `<Greeter/>` component is declared using the `component$()` method and is a Qwik component.  Remove the `component$()` to convert `<Greeter>` to an inline component.

Open the `Symbols` tab and notice that the `<Greeter/>` component is no longer an independent export, but instead is bundled as part of the `<App>` component.
